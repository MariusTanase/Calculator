# Calculator project by ToP

This project is some sort of "homework" that I had to do with what I learnt about
in the Foundation path of The origin project.

I learned and tried different ways until the project worked, rewrite the functions, try many things and did a lot of google-ing when I didn't know things.
Overall, I learned many new things.

Time spent: ~6-8hours

The calculator does basic operations, such as ADD, SUBTRACT, MULTIPLY and DIVIDE and an extra PERCENT button that returns 1% of the value.
There are extra functions for the REMOVE button that removes only 1 item from the end of the calculation row
The CLEAR button clears the entire value of the display.
+/- button returns the value to its opposite such as negative or positive values.
